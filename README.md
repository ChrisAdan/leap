# Take the Leap

## 🕹️ Project Overview

We're simulating an analytics infrastructure for leap, a simulated new online live service game looking to grow their player base. This take-home project demonstrates how to design and implement an end-to-end analytics pipeline, from synthetic data generation to modeling and insights, aligned with real-world analytical use cases like player retention, in-game monetization, and session-level behaviors.

The project focuses on:

- Simulating gameplay events using realistic mock data
- Designing an ingestion and transformation pipeline
- Modeling an analytics warehouse
- Enabling performant, business-critical queries

## 📦 Pipeline Overview

| Stage         | Tooling         | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data Gen      | `main.py`       | Orchestrates all generators (sessions, transactions, products, heartbeats) to produce realistic JSON/CSV event data            |
| Ingest & Load | Python + DuckDB | Loads generated raw event data into `leap_raw` tables in DuckDB                                                                |
| Transform     | dbt             | Transforms raw data through `leap_stage` and `leap_dim` into `leap_mart` models using game-aware logic (e.g., close conflicts) |
| Analysis      | SQL + Jupyter   | Runs performant analytical queries and produces insights from `leap_mart` tables                                               |

## 🧪 Simulated Event Sources

We simulate three primary logging sources reflecting real-time game telemetry:

1. **Session Ends**  
   player_id, session_id, event_date_time, country, event_length_seconds, kills, deaths

2. **In-Game Purchases**  
   transaction_id, player_id, event_date_time, purchase_item, purchase_price, currency, is_recurring, cycle, transaction_type (Battle Pass, Skins, Emotes)

3. **Player Heartbeats**  
   player_id, event_date_time, team_id, session_id, position_x, position_y, position_z

Each player plays at most 1 session per day due to computation constraints. Heartbeats are generated every 30s during active sessions. Purchase behavior varies by player cluster.

---

## 🧠 Analytics Goals

The data model and pipeline are built to enable analysts to answer:

- Daily/weekly/monthly player activity trends
- Player lifecycle metrics (kills/deaths, revenue, streaks)
- Engagement by region
- Real-time game dynamics like **close conflicts**

Close conflicts are derived from heartbeat data in dbt using spatial proximity and time gap logic.

## ⚙️ How To Use Locally

Follow these steps to clone the repo, set up a Python virtual environment, generate synthetic data, and run the full dbt analytics pipeline on your machine:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ChrisAdan/leap.git leap
cd leap

# 2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Install project in editable mode
pip install -e .

# 5. Generate all synthetic data (players, sessions, transactions, etc.)
python scripts/main.py --entrypoint all

# 6. Run dbt to build models and tests
dbt deps
dbt compile
dbt run
dbt test

# 7. Generate and serve dbt documentation site
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve
```

# 💡 Notes

[ ] This setup assumes you have Python and dbt installed and available in your PATH.  
[ ] All generated data is loaded into the local DuckDB database configured in the project.  
[ ] You can adjust data generation by specifying different --entrypoint options to main.py.

To stop serving docs, press Ctrl+C in the terminal running dbt docs serve.
